# ⚡ n8n Automation Workflows

Welcome to my collection of **automation workflows built with [n8n](https://n8n.io)** 🎉  

This repository is my personal playground for building **creative, practical, and sometimes experimental workflows** that solve real-world problems.  
Think of it as an **automation lab** 🧪 — where every workflow has its own mini-project, docs, and setup guide.  

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here
- **Ready-to-use workflows** for tasks like:
  - Tracking product prices 📉  
  - Automating emails ✉️  
  - Scheduling reminders ⏰  
  - And more coming soon…  
- **Well-documented project folders** → each workflow has its own `README.md`, JSON export, and sample outputs.  
- **Safe templates** → no sensitive API keys, just placeholders so you can plug in your own.  

## 🛠 How to Use These Workflows
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/n8n-workflows.git
   cd n8n-workflows
   ```
2. Import any `workflow.json` into your n8n instance.  
3. Replace placeholders like `<SCRAPER_API_KEY>` or `<YOUR_EMAIL>`.  
4. Run it manually or connect it to a trigger (schedule/webhook).

## 🌟 Why n8n?
- **Visual automation builder** → code + no-code flexibility.  
- **Extensible** → supports custom JS/TS/Python logic.  
- **Integrates with almost anything** → APIs, DBs, apps, you name it.
